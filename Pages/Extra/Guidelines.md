# Contributing to Teenageclub
We love your input! We want to make contributing to our project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We develop with Github
We use github to host our site, to track issues and rules requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Ranger-4297/TeenageClub/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Ranger-4297/TeenageClub/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Make feature requests using GitHub's [Pull Requests](https://github.com/Ranger-4297/TeenageClub/pulls)
We use GitHub PR's to keep track of changes, implementations and feature requests. Create a feature request by [opening a new pull request](https://github.com/Ranger-4297/TeenageClub/compare)

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  <h4 class="alert-heading text-dark">Please note!</h4>
  <p>Before you can create a pull request, you need to fork the repository. To learn how to, go to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo" class="alert-link">this link</a></p>
  <p>You will then also need to add your changes to the relevent files. <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request" class="alert-link">How to create a pull request</a></p>

## What type of label(s) do I use:

#### What to include in a bug report

#### What are they for
The `Documentation` label is a tag to signify that our documenation is not up-to-date or for documentation changes. It could be that the rules used on the server donnn't correlate to the ones here.
