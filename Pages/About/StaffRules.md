## General rules

####  <a name="rule-1">Rule 1. Positions are voluntary</a>

Staff positions here at Teenage Club are 100% voluntary, you may leave at any given time. We also hold the right to
remove you at any given time and do not expect you to complain if this happens.


####  <a name="rule-2">Rule 2. Sensitive and confidential material</a>

Teenage Clubs staff team members have access to sensitive and confidential material. Sharing any information you learn
during your duties as staff with individuals who are not in the “need to know” may result in removal from the staff team
and possible blacklisting of staff positions.


#### <a name="rule-3">Rule 3. Professionalism</a>

Staff at all times shall remain professional and impartial while participating as a member of the staff team. This
includes; dealing with staff situations in public chats, or anything you may do as a staff, when not acting as a staff
you can be your normal self as long as you're following the rules. When punishing a user make sure to also list a proper
reason with it in order for us to keep track.


#### <a name="rule-4">Rule 4. Issues within the team</a>

If a staff member is having issues with another staff member, they should always rectify issues privately or contact an
Admin or other. You are not to confront this member in any public channel this is to prevent further conflict among
members.


#### <a name="rule-5">Rule 5. Enforcement of rules</a>

Enforcement of rules shall only be done following the <span style="background-color: #89cff0"><a href="Rules">Servers
        rules & guidelines</a></span>. You will not make up your own rules or punish people if they have not violate
these rules, as-well as, do not take rash decisions. If you are unsure about anything, contact a lead or trusted staff
member.

#### <a name="rule-6">Rule 6. Promotions</a>

Promotions will be handed out to those who is seen fit, complaining or asking about promotions in any chat will only
result in the chance of promotion being drastically reduced. Promotions are not likely to be handed out weekly, they are
only given out when we specifically choose, most of the time the people that are promoted have done a good job being
active and dealing with situations, and tend to be agreed upon by higher staff members.


#### <a name="rule-7">Rule 7. Higher ranks</a>

If a staff member of higher rank is dealing with a situation, let them deal with it, if they also make a request
regarding a situation. Please comprehend as they ask, they are entitled to do this. This also falls under a case where
you are dealing with something in chat, if a staff member of a higher rank tells you to stop, you are to do so
immediately.

#### <a name="rule-8">Rule 8. Failure to follow</a>

As a staff member you are required to follow and enforce the server rules, just because you are a staff member doesn't
mean you get a free pass, failure to follow the rules will result in a possible discharge from the Teenage Club staff
team.

### Voice rules

#### <a name="vrule-1">Rule 1. Voice powers</a>

Muting, deafening, moving or disconnecting members
Server muting, deafening, moving and disconnecting members in a voice channel without valid reason may result in your
voice channel perms being removed.
Appropriate use of said commands may be users ear-raping voice channels, members in the wrong channel et-cetera.

### Disclaimers

#### <a name="dc-1">DC 1. Deleting messages</a>

While you do reserve the right to delete any message, deleting messages just 'for fun' or without valid reasoning is not
acceptable and may result in the loss of permissions.

#### <a name="dc-2">DC 2. Changing and setting nicknames</a>

Moderators reserve the right to change or set nicknames at any given time, although should only do so if a nickname or username violates rules or staff instruction.

#### <a name="dc-3">DC 3. Discretion</a>

As a Moderator, you reserve the right to use your own discretion, even if this rulebook doesn't explicitly state it. However, abusing these rights without acceptable reason leaves you viable for removal of staff.

#### <a name="dc-4">DC 4. Interpretations</a>

Whilst Moderators have the final say in all interpretations, all staff members must do their best to investigate any sort of incident.

#### <a name="dc-5">DC 5. According to rules</a>

Any member of the server is sanctioned in according to the rules. Whether they claim to not of read them or not.

#### <a name="dc-6">DC 6. Staff requests</a>

While allowed to ask members anything <span style="background-color: #89cff0">WITHIN REASON</span>, asking members of things that violate our server staff rules or making outrages is out of the question and can also result in the loss of rank,
depending on what was asked.
